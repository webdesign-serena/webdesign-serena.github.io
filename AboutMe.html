	<!-- 		Hello! My name is Serena and I am a second-year at UC Berkeley studying Economics and Business. I am interested in graphic and product design, UI/UX, web designing, data analytics, and marketing. My interests outside of academics include swimming, fashion/style, traveling around my home city San Francisco, and trying all the best restaurants in the Bay Area.</p>
			<p> I am currently a survey coordinator at the Center for the Built Enviornment where I create surveys and analyze the data results to create a final report. In addition, I am also a part of the marketing committee in Ascend where I focus on developing strategies to promote Ascend as a premier finance and accounting organization. During my free time, I volunteer at the Berkeley Food Pantry and I am a student researcher at the Berkeley Food Institue where we are working on developing a list of vendors that have affordable and sustainable food options for low-income families. We are currently working on developing a navigable map locating the sustainable vendors and other resources available to the community.</p> -->
