        <p class="Skillabl"> <b>Skillabl</b></p>
        <div class="description"> <p>I worked with Skillabl, a career-service platform, from around February to May of 20118 as part of UMA’s  (Undergraduate Marketing Association) Design Team. Our team consisted of around 10 individuals. Skillabl was a start-up with no established brand identity,so our team had a large hand in helping to solidify Skillabl’s brand identity by creating its logo, website mock ups, and a brand book.</p>
        <p> Skillabl works with top employers to help college students and recent graduates acquire valuable skills needed in the workforce, while democratizing opportunities and providing access for all. We are an online community where college students work on meaningful challenges, discover impactful employers, and seek and provide mentorship.</p></div>
